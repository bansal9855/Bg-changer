# Color Changer App

## Project Overview

The **Color Changer App** is a simple React application that allows users to change the background color of the screen by clicking on various color buttons. This application demonstrates the use of React state management and basic styling with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Interactive buttons to change the background color.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- Smooth transitions when changing colors.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The JavaScript library used to build the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.

## How It Works

The application maintains a piece of state that holds the current background color. When a user clicks one of the color buttons, the state updates, which in turn changes the background color of the entire screen.

## Usage

### Example Usage

1. Start the application by running it in your preferred development environment.
2. The initial background color will be **olive**.
3. Click on any of the color buttons to change the background color. The available options are:
   - **Red**
   - **Green**
   - **White**
   - **Blue**
   - **Aliceblue**

### Example of Color Changes

- Clicking on the **Red** button will change the background color to red.
- Clicking on the **Green** button will change it to green.
- Clicking on the **White** button will change the background to white.
- Clicking on the **Blue** button will change it to blue.
- Clicking on the **Aliceblue** button will change it to a light blue color.
